I am an ISTP, or "Virtuoso". ISTP is a personality type with the "Introverted", "Observant", "Thinking", and "Prospecting" traits. They tend to have an individualistic mindset, pursuing goals without needing much external connection. They engage in life with inquisitiveness and personal skill, varying their approach as needed.
